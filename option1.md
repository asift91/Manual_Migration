This document explains how to migrate Moodle from onpremise servers to Azure cloud.

### Option 1: Migrating Moodle with Azure ARM Templates 
-   Migration of Moodle with   Azure ARM Template  creates the infrastructure in Azure and migrate Moodle on it.
-   The Azure infrastructure is the basic skeleton of the resources which will host the Moodle application.

## Prerequisites

-   If the predefined templates does not match with onpremise configuration then upgrade onpremise Moodle, Php, nginx or apache to more recent versions.
-   Must have access to the onpremise servers to take backup of Moodle and database/configurations.
-   Must have a Azure subscription and the Azure Blob storage created before migration.
-   Azure cli must be installed.
-   Must install AZCOPY.
-   This migration activity supports with the following Softwares.
    -   Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
    -   Nginx web server 1.10.3
    -   Apache 2 2.4
    -   MySQL PaaS 5.6, 5.7 or 8.0 database server
    -   PHP 7.2, 7.3, or 7.4
    -   Moodle 3.8 & 3.9

## Migration Approach

-   Migration of Moodle application has 3 phases
    -   Pre Migration
    -   Migration
    -   Post Migration

Following operations are performed in the process of Migration.

-   **Pre Migration**
    
    -   Data Export from onpremise to Azure Cloud
        -   Install Azure CLI
        -   Create Subscription
        -   Create Resource Group
        -   Create Storage Account
        -   Backup of onpremise data
        -   Copy Archive file to Blob storage


-   **Migration**
    
    -   Migration of Moodle
        - Migrating Moodle with Azure ARM Templates.
        - Manual Moodle migration follow the below steps 
        - Copy the onpremise data to the Controller Virtual Machine.
        - onpremise Data and Configuting setup.
       
-   **Post Migration**
    
    -   Update log paths
    -   Update Cron Job
    -   Configuring certs
    -   Restart servers

## Pre Migration

-   **Data Export from onpremise to Azure Cloud:**
    -   **Install Azure CLI**
        -   Install Azure CLI on onpremiseise to  create resource group and to install azure resources.
            ```
            curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash
            ```
        -   Now login into your Azure account
            ```
                az login
            ```
        -   If the CLI can open your default browser, it will do so and load an Azure sign-in page.
        -   Otherwise, open a browser page at  [https://aka.ms/devicelogin](https://aka.ms/devicelogin)  and enter the authorization code displayed in your terminal.
        -   Sign in with your account credentials in the browser.
        -   Sign in with credentials on the command line
            ```
                az login -u <username> -p <password>
            ```
    -   **Download and Install AzCopy:**
        -   Install AzCopy to copy data from onpremise to blob storage.
            ```
                echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/microsoft-ubuntu-xenial-prod/ xenial main" > azure.list
                sudo cp ./azure.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
                sudo apt-key adv --keyserver packages.microsoft.com --recv-keys EB3E94ADBE1229CF
                sudo apt-get update
                sudo apt-get install azcopy
            ```

    -   **Create Subscription:**
        -   User must have Azure subscription.
        -   Select existing subscription or user can add a subscription  [Portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/SubscriptionsBlade), can select  [Pay-As-You-Go](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/offers/ms-azr-0003p/).

    -   **Create Resource Group:**
        -   After creating the subscription, create a  [Portal-Link](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.ResourceGroup).
            ```
                # cmd to create a RG
                az deployment group create --resource-group <resource-group-name> --template-file <path-to-template>
            
            ```
   
    -   **Create Storage Account:**

        -   Create Azure Storage Account in the same Resource Group
        -   Create a  [storage account](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.StorageAccount)  with AutoKind value as "BlobStorage"
            ```
                az storage account create -n storageAccountName -g resourceGroupName --sku Standard_LRS --kind StorageV2 -l eastus2euap -t Account
            ```
        -   The storage account name must be in the combination of lowercase and numericals, click on create button as shown above.
        -   Storage Account is created, can be used to store the onpremise data.
    
    -   **Backup of onpremise data:**
        -   Take backup of onpremise data such as moodle, moodledata, configurations and database backup file to a folder. For pictorial representation [click here](https://github.com/asift91/Manual_Migration/blob/master/images/folderstructure.png).
        -   Moodle and Moodledata
            -   Moodle folder consists of site HTML content and Moodledata contains Moodle site data
        -   Configurations
            -   Copy the php configurations files such as php-fpm.conf, php.ini, pool.d and conf.d folder to phpconfig folder under the configuration folder.
            -   copy the ngnix configuration such as nginx.conf, sites-enabled/dns.conf to the nginxconfig folder under the configuration folder.
            -   copy the apache configuration similarly if the webserver is Apache.
        -   create a backup of database
            -   Before taking backup of database onpremise should have mysql-client to be installed.
                
                ```
                    sudo -s
                    sudo apt install mysql-client
                    mysql -u dbUserName -p
                    # After the above command user will prompted for database password
                    mysqldump -h dbServerName -u dbUserId -pdbPassword dbName > /path/to/location/database.sql
                    # Replace dbServerName, dbUserId, dbPassword and bdName with onpremise database details
                
                ```
        -   Create an archive tar.gz file of backup folder
            ```
                tar -zcvf moodle.tar.gz <source/folder/name>
            ```
            
    -   **Copy Archive file to Blob storage**
        -   Copy the onpremise archive file to blob storage by following command.
            -   To use AzCopy user should generate SAS Token.
            -   Go to the created Storage Account Resource and navigate to Shared access signature in the left panel.
            -   Select the Container checkbox and set the start, expiry date of the SAS token. Click on "Generate SAS and Connection String".
            -   copy the SAS token for further use.
                ```
                    az storage container create --account-name <storageAccontName> --name <containerName> --sas-token <SAS_token>
                    sudo azcopy copy '/path/to/location/moodle.tar' 'https://<storageAccountName>.blob.core.windows.net/<containerName>/<dns>/<SAStoken>
                ```
            -   With the above steps, onpremise compressed data is exported to Azure blob storage.

## Migration

### Migrating Moodle with Azure ARM Templates 
- Moodle installation on Azure can be done two ways.
    - Moodle installation on Azure with 4 predefined template. 
    - Fully Configurable deployment provides various options to select with when the requirement does not match with the predefined ARM templates. [Portal-Link](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2FMoodle%2Fmaster%2Fazuredeploy.json)
- The 4 predefined templates options such as Minimal, Short-to-Mid, Large, Maximal are available on [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/moodle).
    - [Minimal](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2FMoodle%2Fmaster%2Fazuredeploy-minimal.json): This deployment will use NFS, MySQL, and smaller auto scale web frontend VM sku (1 core) that will give faster deployment time (less than 30 minutes) and requires only 2 VM cores currently that will fit even in a free trial Azure subscription.  
    - [Small to Mid](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2FMoodle%2Fmaster%2Fazuredeploy-small2mid-noha.json): Supporting up to 1000 concurrent users. This deployment will use NFS (no high availability) and MySQL (8 vCores), without other options like elastic search or Redis cache.  
    - [Large (high availability)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2FMoodle%2Fmaster%2Fazuredeploy-large-ha.json): Supporting more than 2000 concurrent users. This deployment will use Azure Files, MySQL (16 vCores) and Redis cache, without other options like elastic search.  
    - [Maximum](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2FMoodle%2Fmaster%2Fazuredeploy-maximal.json): This maximal deployment will use Azure Files, MySQL with highest SKU, Redis cache, elastic search (3 VMs), and pretty large storage sizes (both data disks and DB).
- To deploy any of the predefined size template click on the launch option. 
    -   For Moodle architecture diagram [click here](https://github.com/asift91/Manual_Migration/blob/master/images/stack_diagram.png).
- It will redirect to Azure Portal where user need to fill mandatory fields such as Subscription, Resource Group, SSH key, Region. 
![custom_deployment](images/customdeployment.png)
- Click on purchase to start the deployment of Moodle on Azure. Link for pricing [calculator]( https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/ )
- The deployment will install  supported Infrastructure and Moodle
    - Moodle version: 3.8, 3.9 and 3.5  
    - Webserver: nginx or apache2 
    - Nginx version: 1.10.0
    - PHP version: 7.4, 7.3 or 7.2 
    - Database server type: MySQL  
    - MySQL version: 5.6, 5.7 and 8.0 
    - Ubuntu version: 16.04-LTS  
- The infrastructure will create the following resources by using the predefined ARM template: 
- **Network Template:** Network Template will create virtual network,Network Security Group, Network Interface, subnet, Public IP, Load Balancer/App gateway and Redis cache etc. 
     - Creates a virtual network with string as name , apiVersion, Location and DNS server name.
     - The AddressSpace that contains an array of IP address ranges that can be used by subnets
   
    - **Virtual network:** An Azure Virtual Network is a representation of your own network in the cloud. It is a logical isolation of the Azure cloud dedicated to your subscription. When you create a VNet, your services and VMs within your VNet can communicate directly and securely with each other in the cloud. More information on Virtual Network [click here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview).
    - **Network Security Group:** A network security group (NSG) is a networking filter (firewall) containing a list of security rules allowing or denying network traffic to resources connected to Azure VNets. For more information [click here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/security-overview).
    -   **Network Interface:** A network interface enables an Azure Virtual Machine to communicate with internet, Azure and onpremise resources.[click here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-netwAork-interface)
    - **Subnet:** A subnet or subnetwork is a smaller network inside a large network. By default, an IP in a subnet can communicate with any other IP inside the VNET. More information on Subnet [click here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-manage-subnet). 
    - **Public IP:** Public IP addresses are used to communicate Azure resources to the Internet. The address is dedicated to the Azure resource. More information on Public IP [click here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/public-ip-addresses#:~:text=Public%20IP%20addresses%20enable%20Azure,IP%20assigned%20can%20communicate%20outbound). 
    - **Load Balancer:** It is an efficient distribution of network or application traffic across multiple servers in a server farm. Ensures high availability and reliability by sending requests only to servers that are online. More information on Load balancer  [click here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/tutorial-load-balancer#:~:text=An%20Azure%20load%20balancer%20is,traffic%20to%20an%20operational%20VM). 
    - ***Note***: Any of the 4 pre-defined template will deploy Azure Load Balancer,only in Fully Configurable deployment user has choice to choose App Gateway instead of Load Balancer,
    -  **Azure Application Gateway**: It is a web traffic load balancer that enables you to manage traffic to your web applications. Application Gateway can make routing decisions based on additional attributes of an HTTP request, for example URI path or host headers. More information on App Gateway [click here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/overview). 
    - **Redis Cache:** Azure Cache for Redis provides an in-memory data store based on the open-source software Redis. Redis improves the performance and scalability of an application that uses on backend data stores heavily. It is able to process large volumes of application request by keeping frequently accessed data in the server memory that can be written to and read from quickly. [click here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-cache-for-redis/cache-overview). 

- **Storage Template:**  
    -  storage account  template will create a storage account  with FileStorage Kind and Premium LRS replication, Size of 1TB. For more example[click here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview). 
    -   As per the predefined template storage account with Azure files creates File Share.
    -   An Azure storage account contains all of your Azure Storage data objects: blobs, files, queues, tables, and disks. The storage account provides a unique namespace for your Azure Storage data that is accessible from anywhere in the world over HTTP or HTTPS
    - The types of storage accounts are General-purpose V2, General-purpose V1, BlockBlobStorage, File Storage, BlobStorage accounts.
    - Types of Replication are Locally-redundant storage (LRS), Zone-redundant storage (ZRS), Geo redundant storage (GRS)
    - Types of  Performance are Standard, Premium
    - Size(sku):  A single storage account can store up to 500 TB of data and like any other Azure service
    - Below are types of storage account types ARM template support. 
        - NFS: A Network File System (NFS) allows remote hosts to mount file systems over a network and interact with those file systems as though they are mounted locally. This enables system administrators to consolidate resources onto centralized servers on the network. More information on NFS [click here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/nfs/nfs-overview). 
        - GluserFS: It is an open source distributed file system that can scale out in building-block fashion to store multiple petabytes of data. More information on Gluster FS [click here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/high-availability-guide-rhel-glusterfs). 
        - Azure Files: is the only public cloud file storage that delivers secure, Server Message Block (SMB) based, fully managed cloud file shares that can also be cached onpremiseises for performance and compatibility. More information on Azure Files [click here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/files/storage-files-introduction). 
            - NFS and glusterFS:  
                - Replication is standard Locally-redundant storage (LRS)  
                - Type is Storage (general purpose v1) 
            - Azure Files:  
                - Replication is Premium Locally-redundant storage (LRS)  
                - Type is File Storage  
            - These storage mechanisms will differ according to deployment selected such as  
                - NFS and glusterFS will create a container  
                - Azure files will create a file share. 
    -  For Minimal and short2mid the template will support nfs and for Large and Maximal the template will support AzureFiles
    - To access the containers and file share etc. navigate to storage account in resource group in the portal. 
    ![storage_account](images/storage-account.png)
- **Database Template:** 
    - This Database template will creates an Azure Database for MySQL server. [Click-here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/azure/mysql/) 
    - Azure Database for MySQL is easy to set up, manage and scale. It automates the management and maintenance of your infrastructure and database server,including routine updates,backups and security. Build with the latest community edition of MySQL, including versions 5.6, 5.7 and 8.0 
    - To access the database server created navigate to the resource group provided while deployment and go to Azure Database for MySQL server  
    - The database server will have a server name, server admin login name, MySQL version, and Performance Configuration 
    - Ways to connect to database server 
        - Use MySQL client or tools such as MySQL Workbench. 
        - For workbench give the connection name, hostname (server name), username (server admin login name) 
    ![mysqlworkbench](images/mysql-workbench.png)
        - After giving the details test connection. If the connection is successful it will prompt for password .Provide the password to get connected. 
        
- **Virtual Machine Template:** This template will create a  Virtual Machine
    - Controller VM: 
        - Ubuntu OS defaulted to 16.04 
        - A virtual machine is a computer file, typically called an image, which behaves like an actual compute [Click here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/overview/what-is-a-virtual-machine/) 
    - VM extension: 
        - Extension can be small applications that provide post-deployment configuration and automation tasks on Azure VMs.[Click here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/overview) 
        - VM extension will executes a shell script file which installs Moodle on the Virtual Machine and captures the log files. 
        - Log files stderr and stdout are created at the /var/lib/waagent/custom-script/download/0/  
        - User can view the log files as a root user. 

- **Scale Set Template**: 
    -   This template will create a  Virtual Machine Scale Set (VMSS) with the VM instance. [Click here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/overview) 
    - A virtual machine scale set allows you to deploy and manage a set of auto-scaling virtual machines. You can scale the number of VMs in the scale set manually or define rules to auto scale based on resource usage like CPU, memory demand, or network traffic.
    - Autoscaling of VM Instances depends on the CPU utilization. [Click here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/platform/autoscale-overview)  
    - While scaling up an instance a VM is deployed and a shell script is executed to install the Moodle prerequisites and setting up cron jobs. 
    - VM instances have Private IP. 
    - For connecting to VM’s on Scale Set with private IP, follow the steps written in the [document](https://github.com/asift91/Manual_Migration/blob/master/vpngateway.md). 
    

-   ### Manual Moodle migration follow the below steps 

    -   After completion of deployment go to the resource group.  
    -   Update the Moodle folders and configuration in both the controller virtual machine and virtual machine scale set instance.
    -   **Virtual Machine**
    - Login into this controller machine using any of the free open-source terminal emulator or serial console tools 
        - Copy the public IP of controller VM and paste as host name 
        - Expand SSH in navigation panel and click on Auth and browse the same SSH key file given while deployment. 
        - Click on Open and it will prompt to give the username. Give it as azureadmin as it is hard coded in template

## Post Migration

-   Post migration of Moodle application user need to update the certs and log paths as follows

-   **Virtual Machine:**
    
    -   **Log Paths**
        
        -   onpremise might be having different log path location and those paths need to be updated with Azure log paths.
    -   **Certs:**
        -   _SSL Certs_: The certificates for your Moodle application reside in /moodle/certs/
        -   Copy over the .crt and .key files over to /moodle/certs/. The file names should be changed to nginx.crt and nginx.key in order to be recognized by the configured nginx servers. Depending on your local environment, you may choose to use the utility scp or a tool like WinSCP to copy these files over to the cluster controller virtual machine.
        -   You can also generate a self-signed certificate, useful for testing only:
            
            ```
                openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
                -keyout /moodle/certs/nginx.key \
                -out /moodle/certs/nginx.crt \
                -subj "/C=US/ST=WA/L=Redmond/O=IT/CN=mydomain.com"
            
            ```
        -   It's recommended that the certificate files be read-only to owner and that these files are owned by www-data:
            ```
                chown www-data:www-data /moodle/certs/nginx.*
                chmod 400 /moodle/certs/nginx.*
            ```
    -   **Update Time Stamp:**
        -   A cron job is running in the VMSS which will check the updates in timestamp for every minute. If there is an update in timestamp then local copy of VMSS is updated in web root directory.
        -   In Virtual Machine scaleset a local copy of Moodle site data (/moodle/html/moodle) is copied to its root directory (/var/www/html/).
        -   Update the time stamp to update the local copy in VMSS instance.
            ```
                /usr/local/bin/update_last_modified_time.azlamp.sh
            ```
    -   **Restart servers**
        
        -   Restart the nginx and php-fpm servers
            ```
                sudo systemctl restart nginx
                sudo systemctl restart php<phpVersion>-fpm
            ```
        -   If apache is installed as a webserver then restart apache server
            ```
                sudo systemctl restart apache
            ```
    -   **Mapping IP:**
        -   Map the load balancer IP with the DNS name.
    - Hit the load balancer DNS name to get the migrated moodle web page.
